**GoFlare** is a lightweight and flexible handler designed to help you build and deploy **Go-based WebAssembly (WASM)** and **JavaScript** bundles for **Cloudflare Workers**, **Pages**, or **Functions**.

Itâ€™s not a full framework â€” GoFlare is meant to **fit into your existing toolchain**.
You can use it as a standalone build step or attach it to any build or deploy workflow you already have.
